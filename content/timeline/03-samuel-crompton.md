Samuel Crompton invented the spinning mule, but it was patented by Richard Roberts in 1825. The spinning mule combined spinning and weaving into one machine. It would spin textile fibers into yarn by an intermittent process. In the draw stroke, the roving was pulled through the rollers and twisted, and on the return, it was wrapped onto the spindle. This was the most common spinning machine from about 1790-1900.
