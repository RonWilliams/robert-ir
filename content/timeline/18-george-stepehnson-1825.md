George Stephenson, later known as the “Father of Railways,” commissioned a 30-mile railway to be built from Liverpool to Manchester named the Stockton and Darlington Railway. In 1830, Stephenson also built the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, which was the first public inter-city railway line in the world to use locomotives.
