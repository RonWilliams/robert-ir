Eli Whitney, an American inventor, invented and patented the cotton gin. This greatly increased the production of cotton because the machine quickly and easily separated cotton fibers from their seeds. Whitneyâ€™s cotton gin revolutionized the cotton industry in the United States, but also led to the growth of slavery in the South because the demand for cotton harvesting rapidly increased. Therefore, this invention has been identified as a contributing factor to the American Civil War.
