George Stephenson, a British engineer and inventor, patented a steam engine locomotive that ran on rails. He built a locomotive called “Blucher” that could haul eight wagons loaded with 30 tons of coal at a speed of four miles per hour. He later dramatically improved the engine’s steam system to give it greater pulling power. The Blucher was the first fully effective steam railway locomotive.
