Luddite Rebellion begins in Great Britain. Luddites were a secret oath-based organization of English textile workers. This organization attacked factories and smashed textile machinery in protest against the industry. Many Luddites were workshop owners that had to close because factories could sell the same products for a lower price. In 1813, fourteen Luddites were hung at York Castle in England for the murder of manufacturer William Horsfall.
