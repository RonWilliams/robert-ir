In the United States, the Embargo Act of 1807 cut off imports from Great Britain, forcing American merchants to increase the amount of goods they manufacture. This Act, at Thomas Jefferson request, was passed by the United States Congress. Unfortunately, its effects in Europe were not what Jefferson had hoped. In fact, it was actually a hardship on U.S. farmers and New England and New York mercantile and maritime interests.
