John Deere, a blacksmith, invented and manufactured the first successful steel plow in Illinois. The wrought iron steel plow was ideal for the tough soil of Illinois and worked better than the wooden ones that continued to break. He sold one of his steel plows to a local farmer who quickly spread word of how great it was to others. Soon, other farmers were also placing orders.
