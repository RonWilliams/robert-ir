The Boston Manufacturing Company built its first textile mill in Waltham, Massachusetts and introduced the Lowell System. Every step of the manufacturing process was done under one roof and was performed by adult women instead of children. In 1822, the Boston Manufacturing Company started the first large scale factory town in America and named it Lowell after the company founder, Francis Cabot Lowell.
