Samuel Slater, an English American Industrialist known as the “Father of the American Industrial Revolution” by Andrew Jackson, brought British textile technology to the United States and modified it for American use. He designed and opened the first textile mill in Rhode Island. This was the first American factory to successfully produce cotton yarn using water-powered machines.
