James Watt, a Scottish inventor and engineer, patented his improved model of the steam engine, also known as the Boulton and Watt steam engine. This steam engine featured a separate condenser that saved much more fuel than the earlier designs because it avoided the waste of energy. Wattâ€™s design was an early steam engine and was one of the driving forces of the Industrial Revolution. It was many years before the Watt design was replaced.
