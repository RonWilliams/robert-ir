Invented by James Hargreaves in Lancashire, England. It reduced the amount of work needed to produce cloth and allowed workers to produce multiple spools of thread at the same time. However, the yarn produced was not very strong. The Spinning Jenny was one of the key developments in the industrialization of textile manufacturing during the early Industrial Revolution and helped start the factory system of cotton manufacturing.
