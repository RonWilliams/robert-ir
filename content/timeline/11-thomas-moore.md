Thomas Moore, an American farmer, inventor, surveyor, engineer and entrepreneur, invented and patented the first wooden ice box. However, the patent was for a refrigerator, but not like the refrigerators we use today. He invented this box to transport butter to his home in Brookeville, Maryland or from his farm to be sold at market. It enabled him to transport his butter at cooler temperatures.
