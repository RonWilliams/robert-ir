Beverly Cotton Manufactory, the first cotton mill built in America and the largest built during it era, opened in Beverly Massachusetts. Unfortunately, it did not meet economic success due to technical limitations of the early production process and limitations of the machines being used. However, it still has been called the birthplace of the American Industrial Revolution because it was a testing ground of the cotton milling industry at the time. In 1828, Beverly Cotton Manufactory burns down.
