My name is Robert Hughes, and I am an 11th-grade student at Brentsville District High School in Nokesville, VA. I am actively involved in gymnastics and love to play online computer games. I also volunteer at the local fire department as a junior firefighter. Being a full-time high school student, a part-time college, and volunteering doesnâ€™t allow a lot of free time; however, when it does, I love reading about history. Hence, my first website is historical and about the Industrial Revolution.  I am hoping that you all enjoy it as much as I did putting it together.
