An entertaining, engaging and informative book of countless men and women who wedded technological innovation to capitalist profit or nationalist agenda, and in the process, helped usher in the modern era. Gavin Weightman believes the industrial revolution was an incremental process in which credit for any innovation or invention rightly belongs to innumerable individuals scattered throughout the world. His enthusiasm for his characters and his insistence that the Industrial Revolution was the doing of more than a handful of Great Men, propels the book forward. Weightman expertly marshals his cast of characters across continents and centuries forging a genuinely global history that brings the collaborative and competitive business of the industrial innovation to life. Weightman is excellent at demolishing some of the myths surrounding the industrial revolution in this book.
