A compelling account of the Industrial Revolution through hundreds of autobiographies penned between 1760 and 1900. These autobiographies offer firsthand accounts of how the Industrial Revolution was experienced by the working class and the social impact it had rather than its economic and political histories. Emma Griffin provides a brilliant chronical of social history and upending traditional interpretations of the Industrial Revolution. She showed how it raised incomes, improved literacy, and offered exciting new opportunities. Griffin’s account marks a major shift in our understanding of this period that moves beyond economic abstractions because we hear the voices of those who lived through the creation of the world’s first industrial society.
