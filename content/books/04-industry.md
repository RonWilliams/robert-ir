A scholarly and dispassionate analysis that incorporates an economic, social, and political perspective that puts Britain at the forefront of the Industrial Revolution. In this book you will find a combination of a narrative of how the industrial revolution started in Britain, how it effected the people involved, the social structures on society, how the political structure of Britain changed, and how Britainâ€™s colonial ventures were shaped. Eric Hobsbawm uses comparative analysis with contemporary European societies of the 18th and 19th centuries who were also making their first steps towards an industrial society. This book covers more than just the industrial revolution through because it carries the narrative into the last half of the 20th century.
