A historical overview of the transformation of America. In the early 19th century, America was a young nation and minor player in the world; however, at the end of the century, America emerged as the worldâ€™s largest economy and manufacturer. Charles Morris, in this book, traces the American industrial development in the 19th century through multiple pathways. He shows how power generation sprang up on almost every stream, water turbines were developed for major dams, and a railway system crisscrossed the nation. This is a beautifully illustrated book that paints a vivid panorama of a new nation buzzing with the work of creation.
